- Servers are connected to the Internet, Clients (like my PC) are not inherintley connected to the Internet, but instead connect via an ISP (Internet Service Provider).
- A *packet* is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.
- Everything connected directly or indirectly to the Internet has an *IP (Internet Protocol)* address.
- *Routers* direct packets around the Internet, found between IPs. There can be many routers between two communicating IP addresses.
- A *DNS* (Domain Name System) server is essentially the phonebook of the Internet, used to connect domain names with the correct IP address of said site.
